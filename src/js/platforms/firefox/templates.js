If\n        you want the List.it icon to be somewhere else, just right click on one of your\n        toolbars and select \'Customize.\' This will allow you to click and drag the icon,\n        and even remove it completely.\n    </p>\n    <h4>View Menu Item</h4>\n    <p>\n        You can also toggle the sidebar from the Firefox menu. At the top of your browser,\n        you can go to View>Sidebar>List.it which will allow you to open and close the sidebar.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        If you don\'t see a View button, you have your Menu Bar hidden. You can make it appear\n        by right clicking on one of your toolbars and clicking on \'Menu Bar.\'\n    </p>\n    <h4>Hotkey</h4>\n    <p>\n        For your convenience, we\'ve given you a hotkey that you can use anywhere in Firefox.\n        It can also open and close the sidebar. It has a default keyboard shortcut but you can\n        change that by going to the Options Page and adjusting your settings.\n    </p>\n    <table>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Default Shortcut</th><th>Use</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Control+Shift+L</td><td><b>Open/Close the sidebar</b></td>\n        </tr>\n    </table>\n</div>\n';
