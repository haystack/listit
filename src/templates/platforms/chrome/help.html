    <h3>Chrome</h3>
    <h4>Your Preferences</h4>
    <p>
        On the options page, you can choose your settings to change how List.it functions. The first option
        is to open List.it in a chrome addon popup instead of a separate window. This will make the List.it
        sidebar open up on the right side of your Chrome window and it won't always be visible.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second option will cause the List.it window to track the Chrome window. This means that the List.it
        window will stay on the left side of Chrome and if you move your main Chrome window, List.it will move
        with it. Just be aware that this option may use more power and drain your battery.
    </p>
    <p>
        The third option will store the active url in the metadata of your note. This means that when you create
        a new note, it will record whatever website you were browsing in Chrome. Later you'll be able to go back
        and see what site you were looking at when you created a note. If you choose to participate in our
        studies, we'll be able to see this data, but it will only store the active site in your browser. We
        won't know what you were looking at in another tab or window.
    </p>
    <h4>Chrome Omnibox</h4>
    <p>
        You can access List.it from your urlbar. Type "listit" and hit Tab and then begin typing to
        create a new note. Just like the note creator in the sidebar, this will search through your notes
        as you type. When you are finished with your note, hit Enter to save it.
    </p>
    <h4>Other Ways To Add Notes</h4>
    <p>
        While browsing the web, you can create new notes by right clicking and selecting "Add to
        List.it". This will open up a new note that you can edit and save.
        You can add pictures, text, and links to your notes in this way. But, List.it will only 
        store a reference to these items. This means that if they're deleted from the web, they'll also be 
        deleted from your notes. So if you want to keep something forever, save it to your computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the List.it window is open, this will add to the new note creator. If the window is closed
        or you use the addon popup, then a small note box will appear in the bottom right corner of Chrome.
        This works just like the new note creator.
    </p>
    <h4>Additional Hotkeys</h4>
    <p>
        For your convenience, we've given you several keyboard shortcuts that you can use anywhere in Chrome.
        They have default shortcuts, but you can change these if you want. Go to chrome://extensions and scroll
        to the bottom of the page. There is a link for "Keyboard shortcuts" and there you can change the hotkeys
        listed below.
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Default Shortcut</th><th>Use</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Control+L</b></td><td><b>Activate the extension.</b> This will open up the popup or separate
                window.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Control+M</b></td><td><b>Create a new note.</b> This will bring you to the new note
                creator.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Control+Shift+M</b></td><td><b>Create a new note with bookmark.</b> This will bring you to
                the new note creator with a link to the current page included in a note.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </p>
